						<h2>Auto Accidents</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>For anyone who has ever been involved in a motor vehicle collision, the process can be stressful, overwhelming, and financially exhausting.  Often, more questions than answers arise within just the first few days following a crash.  Who will be responsible for fixing my vehicle?  How am I going to be able to work?  Am I going to be responsible for paying my medical bills?</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, the process can often be time consuming, stressful, and can leave victims feeling hopeless.  During this time, communication with the insurance companies can feel as though you are fighting an uphill battle.    All the while, you may be suffering from serious and often permanent injuries as a result of the collision, which only makes things that much worse. </p>

						<h2>Truck Accidents</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>Commercial vehicle, tractor trailer, or semi-truck accidents can cause serious life changing injuries. Trucking collisions can leave victims feeling defenseless and facing a number of overwhelming burdens including the physical and emotional toll of injuries, lost wages, medical expenses, and property damage.   When a motor vehicle accident occurs, including an accident involving a tractor trailer or a commercial vehicle, it is important to take the steps necessary to ensure evidence is preserved and make certain you receive the benefits you are entitled.  If you or someone you love has been injured as a result of a truck accident, please contact Peña Ramas Law.</p>

						<h2>Motorcycle Accidents</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>In today’s day and age, distracted driving has become all too common.  Unfortunately, this all too common practice becomes especially dangerous when a motorcyclist is involved.  If you or someone you know has ever been injured in a motorcycle accident, you understand how truly devastating and stressful this time can be. On top of the emotional toll of dealing with devastating injuries caused in a motorcycle crash, the financial burden of ongoing care and rehabilitation, lost wages, and loss of future earning capacity can be overwhelming.</p>
							<p>Florida insurance laws and disinterested insurance carriers can often complicate the process of recovering compensation for injured motorcyclists.  In addition, it is a very common occurrence that the insurance company will attempt to blame the motorcyclist for causing the collision, regardless of the facts, in an effort to lessen their responsibility and obligation to pay out claims.  Therefore, it is important for injured riders, or those acting on their behalf, to retain an attorney who has experience handling these types of personal injury claims as quickly as possible.</p>

						<h2>Uber/Lyft/Ride Sharing Injuries</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>Technology today affords people easy access to transportation through a variety of different ride share networks.  Over the last ten years, companies such as Uber and Lyft have become increasingly popular to help everyday commuters reach their destinations in a quick, easy fashion.  When individuals retain the services of these ridesharing companies, they expect to reach their destination safely without any incident.  Unfortunately, that is not always the case.  If you, a relative, or loved one was injured in an Uber, Lyft, or rideshare vehicle, please contact us today for a free case evaluation. </p>

						<h2>Pedestrian Accidents</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>Florida has the highest rate of pedestrian deaths in the nation.  When an individual is struck by an automobile, motorcycle, or commercial vehicle, the damages can be catastrophic and sometimes fatal.  In many cases, an individual is left disabled, permanently injured, and struggling to find a way to pay extensive hospital bills.   A distracted driver can often be the difference between a simple walk in the park and a life altering injury.  If you, a relative, loved one, or friend was injured or killed as a pedestrian in Florida, please give us a call.</p>

						<h2>Negligent Security</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>In Florida, business owners, landlords, and property managers have a duty to ensure that visitors and invitees are protected against foreseeable violence on or near their property.  In many cases, business owners, landlords, and property managers can be held liable for failure to provide adequate security, lighting, or warning signs.  Examples of claims pertaining to negligent security often involve assault and battery, sexual assault, robbery, and gun violence.  These horrible crimes can occur almost anywhere, including nightclubs, bars, restaurants, commercial business districts, strip malls, shopping centers, and retail stores.  If you or someone you know has been injured as a result of negligent security, please call us today for a free case evaluation. </p>

							<h2>Nursing Home Negligence</h2>
							<div class="feature-box-desc">
								<p>It is never an easy decision when placing a family member or loved one in the care of a nursing home or assisted living facility.  As a society, our elderly population is one of the most respected classes of individuals, and in many cases, one of the most vulnerable.  When retaining the service of a nursing home or assisted living facility, we hope our loved ones are treated with respect and their needs are fully attended to.  In many cases, the services provided by these entities do not meet our expectations and often times fail to achieve a reasonable standard of care for our loved ones.  Understaffing, negligent hiring, abuse, and neglect are becoming all too common.  Residents subjected to these conditions are at risk for developing bedsores, contracting infection, inadequate hygiene, improper medication administration, and in some cases death.  If you feel a relative or loved one suffered harm as a result of nursing home negligence, contact the attorneys at Peña Ramas Law for a free consultation.</p>

						<h2>Slip and Falls / Premises Liability</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>Slip and fall or trip and fall accidents can occur anywhere at any time.  A wet floor, misplaced floor mat, uneven sidewalk, or faulty stairs are just a few of many unsafe conditions that can cause someone to suffer severe and personal injury at a home or business. The initial shock, especially when these accidents occur in a public setting, can often be confusing and embarrassing.  It is extremely important that you, as a victim of your slip and fall or trip and fall, know your rights. Do not wait to report the incident or document the scene of the fall.  If you or a loved one are injured or suffered harm as a result of a slip and fall or trip and fall incident, you may be entitled to compensation.

						<h2>Dog Bites</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>An unexpected dog bite or attack can often have tremendous long term physical and psychological implications.  Permanent and serious disfigurement, scarring, fear and anxiety of being around animals are just a few of the many effects an unexpected attack can leave on a victim.  Following a dog bite, an individual should seek medical attention as soon as possible.  In addition, it is important to obtain as much information about the dog owner themselves in order to assist in presenting a future claim.</p>

							<p>Our dog bite injury attorneys represent children, adults, mail carriers, utility and service providers, contractors, builders, and pedestrians alike.  Often, an individual who suffers a dog bite is bitten by a friend or family member’s pet.  This, of course, can often cause a great deal of stress when the injured party has a potential claim against a close friend or relative.  The dog bite attorneys at Peña Ramas Law are here to help alleviate your concerns and navigate you through the complicated claims process.</p>

						<h2>Wrongful Death</h2>
						<div class="feature-box-desc">
							<p>There is nothing more tragic than a life taken too soon as a result of some else’s negligence or recklessness.   Unfortunately, distractions such as cell phone use, substance abuse, and driving under the influence are all too common factors that in many cases lead to the loss off an innocent life.  Instead of being afforded the chance to grieve the loss of your loved one, you are surrounded by an overwhelming amount of unanswered questions and confusion.
